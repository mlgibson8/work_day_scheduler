# work_day_scheduler
week 5 project
 for this project we had to Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

 first i had to setup the time-div boxes to change color based on the time, did this by setting up  a time-div containder with moment().format 

 i used a time-block descrition to save the text localy with 
 $("#hour-08 .time-block").val(localStorage.getItem("08"));
